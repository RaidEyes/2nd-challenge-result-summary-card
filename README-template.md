## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

_I have learned so much about the grid and the flex box system. At first I thought I should choose only one to use but then I realized I could combine these 2 for a much better result.

_ I used to scared of media querry but now I have completed this challenge in less than 1 day. I'm very proud of myself.

### Continued development

_ Although I'm very familiar with CSS and HTML now, I still need more challenges to strengthen these guys. I will do at least 5 more challenges before I add my JS.
